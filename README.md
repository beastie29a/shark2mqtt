# shark2mqtt

Bridge SharkNinja robot vacuums to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) via MQTT autodiscovery.

> [!NOTE]
> **EU region support:** Set `SHARK_REGION=eu` to use with EU Shark accounts. Thanks to [@hjennerway](https://github.com/hjennerway) for capturing the EU API traffic that made this possible.

## Confirmed Working Models

A growing list of models confirmed working in the wild lives in [CONFIRMED_MODELS.md](CONFIRMED_MODELS.md). Other SharkNinja robot vacuums likely work too -- the list reflects what's been reported, not the limit of what's supported. If your model isn't on it, please let me know.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the example config and fill in your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp config.example.env .env
   # Edit .env with your Shark account and MQTT broker details
   ```

2. Run with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Home Assistant OS Add-on

Running HAOS? [@400HPMustang](https://github.com/400HPMustang) built an HA add-on that wraps shark2mqtt: **[400HPMustang/shark2mqtt-addon](https://github.com/400HPMustang/shark2mqtt-addon)**. Install it from the HA Add-on Store -- no Docker setup needed.

The add-on is maintained separately. File add-on-specific issues on that repo; shark2mqtt issues stay here.

## Pre-built Image

A pre-built image is available from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name shark2mqtt \
  --env-file .env \
  -v shark2mqtt_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/camsoper/shark2mqtt:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose (no `build` needed):

```yaml
services:
  shark2mqtt:
    image: ghcr.io/camsoper/shark2mqtt:latest
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - shark2mqtt_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  shark2mqtt_data:
```

See [`config.example.env`](config.example.env) for a ready-to-edit template.

## Authentication

shark2mqtt authenticates to SharkNinja's cloud using a browser-based Auth0 flow. The container runs a headed Chromium browser inside a virtual display (`xvfb`) to complete login automatically.

Auth tokens are persisted to the `/data` volume so the browser flow only runs when tokens expire.

To test authentication without starting the full service:

```bash
docker compose run --rm shark2mqtt --auth-once
```

This authenticates, lists discovered vacuums, saves tokens, and exits.

### If the "Verify you are human" challenge never passes

Cloudflare's bot detection occasionally flags the automated browser on some hosts or networks, leaving the Turnstile checkbox unchecked forever (with a red validation border in the failure screenshot). If you've hit this, you can bootstrap tokens on a different machine and copy them over:

1. On a desktop or laptop (ideally on a different network, e.g. your main PC rather than the server), clone this repo and run the auth flow once:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm shark2mqtt --auth-once
   ```

2. Copy `shark2mqtt_tokens.json` from that machine's `/data` volume into the `/data` volume on your server.

3. Start the service normally. It will use the saved refresh token and skip the browser flow entirely.

The refresh token is long-lived, so once you have a working `shark2mqtt_tokens.json` the browser flow shouldn't be needed again unless SharkNinja revokes the session (e.g. after a password change).

Repeated failed attempts can temporarily lock your SharkNinja account, so if the challenge is failing, stop the retry loop (set restart policy to `no` or use `--auth-once`) before trying again.

### If login says "Your account has been locked"

This one is a different animal from the Turnstile problem above, and the message is misleading. The signature is:

- The automated login fails with *"Your account has been locked. Please check your email to log in"*.
- No lockout email ever arrives (check spam).
- Logging into [login.sharkninja.com](https://login.sharkninja.com) by hand, in a normal browser, with the same credentials, works immediately.
- Resetting your password changes nothing -- you get a byte-identical failure screenshot.

That combination means Auth0's risk-based bot detection has flagged the *automated sign-in pattern*, not your account. There is nothing wrong with your credentials and nothing to unlock. Thanks to @dewbot6 for diagnosing this in [#38](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/issues/38).

**What to do:** stop the retry loop and wait it out. Set the restart policy to `no` (or stop the add-on) and leave it alone for several hours -- overnight is a reasonable first attempt. Retrying against an already-flagged pattern tends to extend the block rather than clear it.

While you're waiting, it's worth confirming this isn't just a dead refresh token, which produces a similar "vacuum went unavailable but the app works fine" symptom. Look for this in the logs:

```
Auth0 refresh_token grant failed: <reason>
```

The reason is logged as of v1.5.5. An `invalid_grant` there means the saved token was revoked (a password change will do it), in which case you need a fresh browser login rather than a wait -- see the token bootstrap steps above.

If you hit this, please add what you find to [#38](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/issues/38), especially how long the block took to clear. How long the cooldown actually runs is still an open question.

## Home Assistant Entities

Each vacuum is automatically discovered by Home Assistant with the following entities:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vacuum.<name>` | Vacuum | Main entity with start/stop/pause/return/locate/fan speed |
| `sensor.<name>_battery` | Sensor | Battery level (%) |
| `sensor.<name>_rssi` | Sensor | WiFi signal strength (dBm) |
| `sensor.<name>_error_text` | Sensor | Current error description |
| `binary_sensor.<name>_charging` | Binary Sensor | Charging state |
| `binary_sensor.<name>_error` | Binary Sensor | Error state (on when error present) |
| `button.<name>_clean_<room>` | Button | One-tap room cleaning (one per room) |
| `select.<name>_clean_mode` | Select | Normal, Matrix (double-pass), or Deep (wet) cleaning mode |
| `select.<name>_water_flow` | Select | Mop water flow level (vac+mop models only) |

Room buttons and the clean mode select appear automatically when room data is available from the Shark cloud. The water flow select appears only on models that report `Flow_Mode` -- i.e. those with a mop tank -- so vacuum-only models won't get a control their hardware ignores.

An error device trigger fires when a new error is detected, usable in HA automations.

### Vacuum States

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `cleaning` | Vacuuming, mopping, or exploring |
| `paused` | Paused mid-clean |
| `returning` | Returning to dock |
| `docked` | On dock, idle or charging |
| `idle` | Stopped, not docked |
| `error` | Error detected |

### Fan Speeds

`eco`, `normal`, `max` — set via the fan speed control on the vacuum card. The selected speed is preserved while docked (the hardware resets to eco, but shark2mqtt remembers your choice).

## Commands

Standard vacuum commands (start, stop, pause, return to base, locate) work through the Home Assistant vacuum card.

### Room Cleaning

When room data is available from the Shark cloud, shark2mqtt creates **button entities** for each room (e.g., `button.shark_robot_clean_kitchen`). Press a button to start cleaning that room.

A **Clean Mode** select entity (`select.shark_robot_clean_mode`) lets you toggle between:

- **Normal** — single-pass clean
- **Matrix** — two-pass UltraClean (deep clean)
- **Deep** — wet/mop clean; only appears on vac+mop models that report a mop plate

The selected mode applies to all room button presses.

### Advanced: `vacuum.send_command`

For automations that need multi-room cleaning or fine-grained control, you can still use `vacuum.send_command`:

#### Clean a Single Room

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.shark_robot
data:
  command: clean_room
  params:
    room: "Kitchen"
```

#### Clean Multiple Rooms

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.shark_robot
data:
  command: clean_rooms
  params:
    rooms: ["Kitchen", "Living Room"]
    clean_type: "dry"       # optional, default: dry
    clean_count: 1          # optional, default: 1
```

#### Deep Clean (Matrix Clean)

Two-pass UltraClean mode:

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.shark_robot
data:
  command: matrix_clean
  params:
    room: "Kitchen"
```

## Contributing

This project scratches a personal itch — I'm sharing it in case it helps others, not looking to take on a maintenance burden. If something doesn't work for you, please submit a **pull request** rather than an issue. I only own two vacuum models, so I can't test or troubleshoot devices I don't have. PRs with fixes or support for additional models are welcome; issues requesting changes are likely to be closed.

### Capturing a shadow dump

Nearly every model-specific fix here started as a shadow dump from someone else's hardware, so if you're reporting or fixing behaviour on a model I don't own, this is the single most useful thing to include.

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` and look for these lines, logged once per poll cycle per device:

```
Shadow values for <name>: {...}        # skegox backend
Ayla property values for <name>: {...} # Ayla backend
```

That's every property the device reports, **with its value**. Long blobs (map URLs, error logs) are truncated so the line stays readable.

Two things worth knowing:

- Some properties only hold their interesting value while a clean is actively assigned. `AreasToClean_V3`, for example, reverts to `*` once the robot docks, so start the clean and capture within the first couple of poll cycles. Setting `POLL_INTERVAL_ACTIVE=5` helps.
- Dumps contain your DSN, floor IDs, and room names. Redact them before posting.

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to the folks who've made this project better than I could've made it alone:

- [@hjennerway](https://github.com/hjennerway) -- captured the EU API traffic that made EU region support possible.
- [@hslabbert](https://github.com/hslabbert) -- patiently dug through round after round of DEBUG shadow dumps to shake out the room-naming bugs on PowerDetect models ([#4](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/issues/4)). Led to the MARD-as-authoritative-room-source fix.
- [@400HPMustang](https://github.com/400HPMustang) -- built the [Home Assistant OS add-on](https://github.com/400HPMustang/shark2mqtt-addon).
- [@Shadinss](https://github.com/Shadinss) -- ran capture after capture on RV2820YEUS mop behaviour ([#27](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/issues/27)), turning up the `cleantype: "wet"` payload and error code 48. Also the reason shadow dumps now log property *values* -- he was the one who pointed out they only ever logged the names.
- [@dewbot6](https://github.com/dewbot6) -- worked out that Auth0's "your account has been locked" message is bot detection flagging the automated login rather than a real lock ([#38](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/issues/38)), and found the `page.goto()` call sitting outside the try/except that fed the circuit breaker ([#37](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/pull/37)).
- [@xytras78](https://github.com/xytras78) -- caught that dry room cleans report `Operating_Mode 6` and had therefore been showing as `idle` in Home Assistant for their entire duration ([#39](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/pull/39)). Tested every mode on hardware and wrote down the negative result for mode 5 so nobody has to run that experiment again.
- [@adurham](https://github.com/adurham) -- added mop water flow level control after spotting `Flow_Mode` in a shadow dump ([#36](https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt/pull/36)), with a control test against the known-good `Power_Mode` path.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CamSoper/shark2mqtt.git
cd shark2mqtt
docker build -t shark2mqtt .
```

The image is ~1.2 GB due to the bundled Chromium browser required for authentication.
